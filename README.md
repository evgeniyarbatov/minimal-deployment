# Minimal K8S Deployment

Imagine you have a bunch of NodeJS scripts which are running on localhost. 

Your goal is to make sure that those NodeJS scripts are running reliably and you can monitor them.

The plan is to create a minimal K8S setup and Kibana monitoring. The focus is on making it as lighweight as possible.
